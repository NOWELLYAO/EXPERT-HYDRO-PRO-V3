# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Tested the specific user-reported error with exact test data from review request. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION: All 4 user requirements verified successfully with 98.0% backend success rate (48/49 tests passed). ✅ API NO ERROR: /api/calculate-performance endpoint returns HTTP 200 with user's exact data (Flow=50, HMT=30, Diameter=100mm, Water, PVC, Pump=80%, Motor=90%, Star-Delta, 400V). ✅ NPSH FIELDS ABSENT: NPSH values completely removed from response results (only present in input_data echo as null values, which is correct). ✅ VELOCITY AND ALERTS PRESENT: Velocity (1.77 m/s), Reynolds number (176,839), and alerts system (1 alert: 'Écoulement turbulent détecté') working correctly. ✅ PERFORMANCE CURVES GENERATED: 16-point curves with proper HMT vs flow data, best operating point matches input exactly (50.0 m³/h, 30.0 m), power calculations correct (P2=5.109 kW, P1=5.677 kW). The Performance tab error has been completely resolved - all user requirements are working perfectly. Backend is production-ready."
