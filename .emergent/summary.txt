The previous AI engineer effectively transformed a hydraulic pump calculation MVP into a comprehensive, multi-tabbed application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The development was highly iterative, responding to continuous user feedback to enhance engineering accuracy and user experience. Key achievements include refining hydraulic/electrical calculations, integrating dynamic performance curves, implementing alert systems, and localizing the application to French. A significant focus was on the Expert tab, which now supports complex inputs, dynamic schemas, detailed advice, and professional report generation (PDF/Excel with branding). The engineer meticulously addressed input field behaviors, extended fluid lists, and introduced major new sections for FORMULAS, CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY, and AUDIT. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively working on integrating the rich chemical compatibility data into the Expert recommendations, aiming to suggest optimal materials and components.

<product_requirements>
The application's core objective is to provide an interactive platform for hydraulic centrifugal pump calculations, aiding professionals in sizing, performance evaluation, and operational control through graphical visualization and detailed computation.

The system currently offers:
*   **NPSHd Calculation**: Comprehensive inputs for velocity, head losses, NPSHd, including , cavitation alerts, and a dynamic installation schema.
*   **HMT Calculation**: Determines velocities, total head losses, and Total Dynamic Head (HMT) for various installations.
*   **Performance Analysis & Electrical**: Calculates efficiency, current, and cable section, displaying interactive performance curves with an optimal operating point.
*   **Expert Tab**: Delivers in-depth hydraulic/electrical analysis, real-time results, dynamic schemas, and expert advice, supporting professional report generation with project and branding details.

Recent major enhancements included allowing  or  input values in the Expert tab fields (and fixing backspace clearing), introducing a **FORMULAS Tab** for physical equations, significantly **extending the fluid list** (industrial, food, domestic fluids), adding a **CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY Tab** (fluid-material compatibility via dropdown), and developing an **AUDIT Tab** with Hydraulic Audit and Energy Audit sub-sections for expert analysis and recommendations. The immediate next requirement is to integrate fluid-material compatibility into Expert recommendations.

The application is a full-stack web application structured with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Central to the backend, defining FastAPI endpoints and all core calculation logic (hydraulic, electrical, performance analysis) and data models. Handles MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Refinements to  and . Expanded  to include a wide range of industrial, food, and domestic fluids with their  and  data. Added  for detailed material compatibility.  was updated to handle the expanded fluid data structure. The API endpoints, especially , were enhanced to utilize these new fluid properties.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component, managing the application's UI, state, API calls, and displaying dynamic results including charts and SVG diagrams. It hosts all major tabs and their corresponding components.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented a multi-tab interface including NPSHd, HMT, Performance, Historique, Expert, and new FORMULAS, CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY, and AUDIT tabs. Significant work on the Expert tab involved adding project information fields, PDF/Excel export, dynamic SVG schema enhancements (fluid properties display), DN dropdowns, and smart default values. Crucially, input fields in the Expert tab were modified to correctly allow  and  values, and to permit clearing with backspace (by adjusting  handlers and  to allow empty strings and convert to  only for API calls). A new  component was created for the FORMULAS tab. A  component was developed, initially with search, then refined to a dropdown-based UX. An  component was added for the AUDIT tab, encompassing Hydraulic Audit and Energy Audit sub-sections. A  function was introduced within  to handle frontend-side dynamic calculation and display of fluid properties, resolving NaN issues.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains custom CSS rules that complement Tailwind CSS for specific visual adjustments.
    -   **Changes**: Includes rules to hide default up/down arrows in numeric input fields, improving UI consistency.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Summary**: List Python and Node.js dependencies, respectively.
    -   **Changes**: Updated incrementally to reflect new libraries and tools added throughout the development process for new features.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the Expert tab by integrating chemical compatibility data into its recommendations. This directly follows the extensive work on developing new tabs (FORMULAS, CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY, AUDIT), expanding the fluid list with industrial, food, and domestic fluids, and resolving input field issues (allowing 0/0.5 and backspace clearing) in the Expert tab.

Specifically, the engineer has just begun the task by:
1.  **Backend ()**: Populating a detailed  dictionary and extending the existing  with compatibility information for a vast range of fluids. The very last action in the trajectory (Chat Message 280) indicates the engineer is about to create a function to leverage this data and integrate it into the  endpoint, which is crucial for influencing the expert recommendations on materials.
